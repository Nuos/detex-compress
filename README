---- Introduction ----

detex-compress is a fast texture compression utility that makes use of the
detex library. As opposed to texgenpack, which uses a general and versatile
but slow compression method, detex-compress uses relatively fast compression
algorithms specifically optimized for a texture compression format. In the
current version, only BC1 (S3TC) compression is supported. The utility is
multi-threaded and can compress a 1024x1024 BC1 texture within about 10 seconds
with good quality.

The program makes uses of detex (https://github.com/hglm/detex) and
DataSetTurbo (https://github.com/hglm/DataSetTurbo).

It is the intention that support for more compression formats will added in
the future.

---- Compilation and installation ----

To compile, detex and DataSetTurbo are required. Running 'make' will compile
the main program detex-compress and running 'sudo make install' will install
it into the directory defined in Makefile.conf (/usr/bin by default).

As an example, the following commands can be used to install DataSetTurbo,
detex and compile and install the compression utility.

	git clone https://github.com/hglm/DataSetTurbo.git
	cd DataSetTurbo
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ..
	git clone https://github.com/hglm/detex.git
	cd detex
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ..
	cd detex-compress
	make
	sudo make install

--- Usage ----

Run detex-compress without arguments for a list of all available options.

The --tries option sets the number of tries that will be performed to compress
each 4x4 pixel block. The default is one. A higher number of tries results in
better quality at the expense of running time.

The --modal option causes a compression try to be performed for each mode
supported by the compression format. The non-modal option disables modal
operation. Since BC1/S3TC has two modes, modal operation will double the amount
of tries. Modal operation can increase quality and improves worst-case quality
by make sure each compression mode is sufficiently explored. For the BC1
format, modal operation is the default.

Example command lines:

	detex-compress --format BC1 texture.png texture.dds
	detex-compress --format BC1 --non-modal texture.png texture.ktx
	detex-compress --format BC1 --tries 4 texture.png texture.ktx
	detex-compress --decompress texture.ktx texture-decompressed.ktx
